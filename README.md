TASK: 
1) Header: it is necessary to display the current exchange rate (USD, EUR) against the hryvnia (UAH), use any open API. 
2) One currency should have its own input + select. Separate input + select for the second currency. In input we set a number to indicate the number of units to convert. The select must contain at least 3 currencies. 
3) Conversion must occur in both directions. When changing the value in the first currency, the value in the second currency must be recalculated and vice versa. When changing the currency in select, the conversion of both currencies should be recalculated correctly.
